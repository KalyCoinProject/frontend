# Farm Page Issues and Solutions Documentation

## Current Status
The farm page is displaying pools but showing "N/A" data and "This farming period has ended. No new deposits accepted" messages for all pools. The page is stable (no more infinite loops) but not showing real contract data.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Primary Issue: No Real Contract Data**
- **Problem**: All pools show "N/A" for TVL, pool rates, and other metrics
- **Symptom**: "This farming period has ended. No new deposits accepted" message appears on all pools
- **Root Cause**: Contract calls are either failing or returning empty/zero values

### 2. **Limited Pool Discovery**
- **Problem**: Only checking one hardcoded pair address in `getWhitelistedPools`
- **Original Code**: Only checked `'0x25FDDaF836d12dC5e285823a644bb86E0b79c8e2'` (WKLC/USDT)
- **Impact**: Missing other potential farming pools

### 3. **Provider/Wallet Integration Issues**
- **Problem**: `useFarmingContracts` was trying to use `provider` from `useWallet` hook
- **Issue**: `useWallet` hook doesn't expose a `provider` property
- **Impact**: Contract calls failing due to missing provider

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Provider Issues**
**Files Modified**: `frontend/src/hooks/farming/useFarmingContracts.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Removed dependency on `provider` from `useWallet` hook
- Created `getProvider()` function that uses KalyChain RPC directly:
  ```typescript
  const getProvider = useCallback(() => {
    return new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.kalychain.io/rpc')
  }, [])
  ```
- Updated all contract creation to use the new provider function

### 2. **Enhanced Pool Discovery**
**Files Modified**: `frontend/src/hooks/farming/useFarmingContracts.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `getWhitelistedPools` to check all configured pools from farming config
- Added dynamic import of `LP_FARMING_POOLS` from config
- Added comprehensive logging to track which pools are being checked
- Now checks all 6 configured pools: WKLC-KSWAP, WKLC-USDT, KSWAP-USDT, WKLC-USDC, WKLC-BTC, WKLC-ETH

### 3. **Added Comprehensive Debugging**
**Files Modified**: 
- `frontend/src/hooks/farming/useFarmingContracts.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/farming/useFarmingData.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Added detailed console logging for all contract calls
- Log contract call results and failures
- Track which pools are whitelisted vs not whitelisted
- Log vesting parameters and period calculations
- Changed default `isPeriodFinished` from `true` to `false` in mock data

### 4. **Fixed Component Dependencies**
**Files Modified**: 
- `frontend/src/components/farming/ClaimRewardModal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/farming/StakingModal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/farming/UnstakingModal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/farming/RewardTokens.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated method names to match available farming contract methods
- Fixed TypeScript errors with undefined token handling
- Updated dependency arrays in useCallback hooks

### 5. **Created Contract Testing Infrastructure**
**Files Created**:
- `frontend/src/test-farming-contracts.ts` - Direct contract testing script
- `frontend/src/app/test-contracts/page.tsx` - Browser-based contract testing page

**Purpose**: Allow direct testing of contract calls to verify if contracts are responding correctly

## Current Contract Configuration

### Contract Addresses (KalyChain)
- **LiquidityPoolManagerV2**: `0xe83e7ede1358FA87e5039CF8B1cffF383Bc2896A`
- **TreasuryVester**: `0x4C4b968232a8603e2D1e53AB26E9a0319fA33ED3`
- **RPC Endpoint**: `https://rpc.kalychain.io/rpc`

### Configured Pools
1. **WKLC-KSWAP**: Pair address to be fetched dynamically
2. **WKLC-USDT**: `0x25FDDaF836d12dC5e285823a644bb86E0b79c8e2`
3. **KSWAP-USDT**: Pair address to be fetched dynamically
4. **WKLC-USDC**: Pair address to be fetched dynamically
5. **WKLC-BTC**: Pair address to be fetched dynamically
6. **WKLC-ETH**: Pair address to be fetched dynamically

## Contract Methods Being Called

### LiquidityPoolManagerV2
- `numPools()` - Get total number of pools
- `isWhitelisted(address)` - Check if pair is whitelisted for farming
- `weights(address)` - Get pool weight for rewards distribution

### TreasuryVester
- `vestingEnabled()` - Check if vesting is active
- `vestingAmount()` - Get total vesting amount
- `vestingCliff()` - Get vesting cliff timestamp
- `halvingPeriod()` - Get halving period duration
- `lastUpdate()` - Get last update timestamp

## Next Steps for Investigation

### 1. **Verify Contract State**
- Use the test contract page at `/test-contracts` to verify:
  - Are the contracts deployed and accessible?
  - Are any pools actually whitelisted?
  - Is vesting enabled in TreasuryVester?
  - What are the actual values returned by contract calls?

### 2. **Check Contract Deployment**
- Verify contract addresses are correct for current deployment
- Check if contracts have been initialized properly
- Verify if any pools have been added to the whitelist

### 3. **Investigate Pair Addresses**
- Most pools have `undefined` pair addresses in config
- Need to either:
  - Fetch pair addresses dynamically from DEX factory
  - Get correct pair addresses from deployment records
  - Add missing pair addresses to farming config

### 4. **Verify Vesting Configuration**
- Check if TreasuryVester has been configured with:
  - Vesting amount > 0
  - Vesting enabled = true
  - Proper cliff and halving period settings

## Files Modified in This Session

1. `frontend/src/hooks/farming/useFarmingContracts.ts` - Major refactoring
2. `frontend/src/hooks/farming/useFarmingData.ts` - Minor fixes
3. `frontend/src/components/farming/ClaimRewardModal.tsx` - Method name fixes
4. `frontend/src/components/farming/StakingModal.tsx` - Method name fixes
5. `frontend/src/components/farming/UnstakingModal.tsx` - Method name fixes
6. `frontend/src/components/farming/RewardTokens.tsx` - TypeScript fixes
7. `frontend/src/app/farm/[token0]/[token1]/[version]/page.tsx` - CSS path and TypeScript fixes
8. `frontend/src/test-farming-contracts.ts` - New testing utility
9. `frontend/src/app/test-contracts/page.tsx` - New testing page

## Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: Fixed all type errors
- ✅ Build process: Successful compilation
- ✅ Runtime errors: Fixed provider undefined error
- ⚠️ Data display: Still showing N/A values (needs contract investigation)

## Recommended Next Actions
1. Run the contract test page to verify actual contract state
2. Check browser console for detailed contract call logs
3. Verify contract addresses and deployment status
4. Investigate missing pair addresses for dynamic pools
5. Check if farming rewards have been properly initialized on-chain
